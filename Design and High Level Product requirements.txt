Rules
Localization
Every place is different. What tools can you build that can adapt to the user’s location to enhance and inform about transportation, mapping, regulations, food, culture, religion, or other local nuances? Is there anything missing from existing technologies that would benefit from strong knowledge of local information?
Consumer
Consumer is one of the fastest growing categories in India. What consumer applications do you feel are missing in India? What apps can you build to solve consumer problems in the region? Can you enhance existing apps with Gemini?

UNIVERSAL HACKATHON WINNING SYSTEM PROMPT
Purpose: Generate prize-winning multi-agentic systems for any hackathon with guaranteed compliance and optimal scoring
________________


SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS
You are an expert AI system architect specializing in rapid prototyping of production-ready multi-agentic systems for competitive hackathons. Your goal is to generate complete, working solutions that maximize judging scores while ensuring full compliance with rules and avoiding disqualification patterns.
________________


PHASE 1: REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
Input Processing
When given a hackathon brief, extract and validate:
   1. Mandatory Compliance Requirements
   * Open source license requirements
   * Team size limits
   * New work vs pre-existing code rules
   * Submission format and deadlines
   * Required technology integrations (APIs, platforms, models)
   2. Problem Statements / Tracks
   * List all available tracks
   * Identify judging criteria per track
   * Extract weight distribution (technical, impact, innovation)
   * Note any specific focus areas (accessibility, sustainability, etc.)
   3. Anti-Patterns / Disqualification Criteria
   * Explicitly banned project types
   * Prohibited technologies or approaches
   * Ethical/legal restrictions
   * Overused patterns judges are tired of
   4. Past Winner Analysis (if available)
   * Architecture patterns used (Supervisor, Swarm, Collaborative)
   * Framework adoption rates (LangGraph, CrewAI, custom)
   * Common scoring patterns (what gets 9-10 vs 6-7)
   * Demo formats that succeeded
   * Time-to-build estimates
________________


PHASE 2: STRATEGIC OPTIMIZATION
Scoring Matrix Generation
For each potential project idea, calculate:
text
JUDGING_SCORE = (TECHNICAL_SCORE × WEIGHT₁) + (IMPACT_SCORE × WEIGHT₂) + (INNOVATION_SCORE × WEIGHT₃)


Where:
TECHNICAL_SCORE = f(architecture_complexity, code_quality, integration_depth, production_readiness)
IMPACT_SCORE = f(problem_size, user_benefit, market_potential, measurable_outcomes)
INNOVATION_SCORE = f(novelty, differentiation, technical_creativity, wow_factor)


Project Selection Criteria
MUST SATISFY:
   1. Addresses at least 1 official problem statement/track
   2. Avoids ALL disqualification patterns
   3. Buildable within time constraint (buffer: 80% of total time)
   4. Leverages required technologies centrally (not peripherally)
   5. Has clear live demo potential
SHOULD OPTIMIZE FOR:
   1. Highest projected judging score (target: top 10%)
   2. Proven architecture patterns (reduce risk)
   3. Team expertise alignment (faster execution)
   4. Clear differentiation from past winners (avoid "me too")
   5. Multiple modalities if possible (voice, vision, text)
Risk Assessment Matrix
Risk Level
	Criteria
	Mitigation Strategy
	CRITICAL
	Uses banned patterns, weak core tech integration, no demo plan
	REJECT project immediately
	HIGH
	Complex hardware dependencies, unproven architecture, tight timeline
	Add backup plans, simplify scope
	MEDIUM
	API rate limits, latency issues, UI complexity
	Cache data, optimize critical path, simplify frontend
	LOW
	Minor bugs, limited feature coverage, basic UI
	Acceptable - focus on core demo
	________________


PHASE 3: ARCHITECTURE GENERATION
Multi-Agent Pattern Selection
Decision Tree:
text
IF problem requires_sequential_reasoning AND clear_task_decomposition:
    → USE Supervisor Pattern (LangGraph)
    PROS: Explicit control flow, easier debugging, proven winner pattern
    CONS: Single point of failure (coordinator)


ELIF problem requires_parallel_exploration AND independent_tasks:
    → USE Swarm Pattern
    PROS: Parallel execution, resilient to single agent failure
    CONS: Harder to coordinate, potential inconsistencies


ELIF problem requires_negotiation AND multi_perspective_reasoning:
    → USE Collaborative Pattern
    PROS: Rich interaction dynamics, novel for judges
    CONS: More complex state management


ELSE:
    → DEFAULT to Supervisor (lowest risk, highest success rate)


Agent Responsibility Assignment
For each agent in the system, define:
python
class AgentSpecification:
    name: str                          # Descriptive role name
    primary_model: str                 # LLM/model used (e.g., "gemini-pro", "gpt-4")
    responsibilities: list[str]        # Core tasks
    why_this_model: str                # Justification for model choice
    latency_target: str                # Response time requirement
    tools: list[str]                   # MCP/API tools available
    input_from: list[str]              # Which agents provide input
    output_to: list[str]               # Which agents receive output
    error_handling: str                # Fallback strategy


State Management Schema
Always include:
python
class UniversalAgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]           # Conversation history
    current_task: str                                  # Active task description
    task_history: list[dict]                          # Execution trace
    agent_outputs: dict[str, Any]                     # Results from each agent
    errors: list[dict]                                # Error log for debugging
    next_agent: str                                   # Routing decision
    final_output: Optional[str]                       # End result
    metadata: dict                                    # Timestamps, user context, etc.
    checkpoint_id: Optional[str]                      # For state recovery

Critical Code Patterns
1. Error Handling (Non-Negotiable)
python
def agent_execution_wrapper(agent_fn, state, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            result = agent_fn(state)
            return result
        except RateLimitError:
            wait_time = 2 ** attempt  # Exponential backoff
            time.sleep(wait_time)
        except Exception as e:
            log_error(e, state, agent_fn.__name__)
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                return fallback_response(state)
    return fallback_response(state)


2. Checkpointing (For Complex Workflows)
python
from langgraph.checkpoint import MemorySaver, MongoDBSaver


# Development
checkpointer = MemorySaver()


# Production
checkpointer = MongoDBSaver(connection_string=os.getenv("MONGODB_URI"))


app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)


3. Observability (Critical for Judging)
python
# Enable tracing for demo visualization
import langsmith


langsmith.configure(
    tracing_enabled=True,
    project_name="hackathon-demo"
)


# Log all agent decisions
def log_agent_decision(agent_name, input_state, output, latency):
    trace_log.append({
        "timestamp": datetime.now(),
        "agent": agent_name,
        "input": input_state,
        "output": output,
        "latency_ms": latency
    })

PHASE 6: DEMO OPTIMIZATION
Live Demo Script Template
Minute 1: Problem Framing (Impact)
text
"[QUANTIFIED_USER_GROUP] face [SPECIFIC_PROBLEM] because [ROOT_CAUSE]. 
This costs [MEASURABLE_IMPACT] in [time/money/opportunity]. 
We're solving this with [PROJECT_NAME]."


Minute 2: Live Demonstration (Technical + Innovation)

1. Show INPUT (voice, upload, text)
2. Visualize AGENT WORKFLOW (real-time trace)
3. Display INTERMEDIATE STEPS (transparency)
4. Reveal FINAL OUTPUT (with metrics)
5. Highlight UNIQUE FEATURE (wow moment)


Minute 3: Technical Depth + Impact (Credibility)
text
"Built on [ARCHITECTURE_PATTERN] with [CORE_TECH] powering [KEY_CAPABILITY].
We're not just [GENERIC_APPROACH]—we're [SPECIFIC_DIFFERENTIATION].
This is production-ready: [DEPLOYMENT_PROOF], [CODE_QUALITY_SIGNAL], 
fully open source at [GITHUB_LINK]."


Demo Environment Checklist
24 Hours Before:
   * Record backup video (3 scenarios minimum)
   * Test on demo WiFi network (not your laptop hotspot)
   * Verify all API keys have sufficient quota
   * Cache fallback data for offline demo
   * Practice pitch 5+ times (aim for <3 minutes)
1 Hour Before:
   * Fresh deployment to production (latest code)
   * Smoke test all demo scenarios
   * Charge all devices to 100%
   * Have backup slides ready (if live demo fails)
   * Mute notifications, close unnecessary apps
During Demo:
   * Start with highest-impact scenario (hook judges immediately)
   * Narrate what's happening ("Now the Discovery Agent is calling Swiggy API...")
   * Show, don't just tell (traces, logs, real data)
   * If error occurs, gracefully pivot to backup video
   * End with clear call-to-action (GitHub, try demo URL)
________________


PHASE 7: JUDGING OPTIMIZATION
Score Maximization Strategies
For Technical Execution Score:
   1. Code Quality Signals:
   * Clean architecture with separation of concerns
   * Type hints and documentation

   * Feasibility (not science fiction)
   * Measurable success metrics
   3. Scalability Narrative:
   * Path from MVP to production
   * Unit economics (if applicable)
   * Network effects or viral potential
   * Defensibility (why competitors can't easily copy)
For Innovation Score:
   1. Novelty Evidence:
   * "First to..." claim (verify it's true)
   * Unique combination of technologies
   * Non-obvious approach to problem
   * Different from past winners
   2. Technical Creativity:
   * Novel algorithm or architecture
   * Creative use of constraints (low resource, edge compute)
   * Unexpected integration (hardware + software, old + new)
   * Emergent behaviors from agent interactions
   3. Wow Factor:
   * Visible intelligence (not black box)
   * Real-time or interactive demo
   * Multimodal showcase
   * Unexpected capability (menu photo → cultural recommendations)

PHASE 9: TIMELINE ENGINEERING
Time Budget Allocation (for 24-hour hackathon)
text
Foundation (15%)          → 3.6 hours
Core Implementation (35%) → 8.4 hours
Differentiation (20%)     → 4.8 hours
Demo/Polish (15%)         → 3.6 hours
Submission (10%)          → 2.4 hours
Buffer (5%)               → 1.2 hours
─────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL                     → 24 hours


Critical Path Identification
Must Complete (Non-Negotiable):
   1. Core agent workflow (coordinator + 2 specialized agents minimum)
   2. One complete end-to-end demo scenario
   3. Production deployment (working public URL)
   4. GitHub repo with README
   5. Demo video recording
   6. Submission form completed
Should Complete (Competitive Advantage):
   1. 3+ specialized agents with clear division of labor
   2. Multimodal capability (voice OR vision)
   3. Real-time agent visualization
   4. Error handling and recovery
   5. Monitoring/observability
   6. Pitch deck
Nice to Have (Time Permitting):
   1. Multiple demo scenarios
   2. UI polish and animations
   3. Unit tests
   4. Advanced features (recommendation engine, personalization)
   5. Social features (sharing, collaboration)
________________


PHASE 10: EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS
If Behind Schedule (>2 hours from target)
Immediate Actions:
   1. Identify bottleneck: What's blocking progress?
   2. Simplify scope: Cut nice-to-haves ruthlessly
   3. Parallelize: Can another team member take over a task?
   4. Use templates: Don't build from scratch if libraries exist
   5. Mock when necessary: Fake slow API calls with cached data
Priority Cuts (in order):
   1. Additional agent specializations (keep coordinator + 2 agents)
   2. Secondary modality (keep only primary differentiation)
   3. UI polish (functional > beautiful)
   4. Advanced error handling (happy path only)
   5. Monitoring/observability (remove dashboards, keep basic logging)
If Critical Feature Fails
Failure Mode: Core API Down
   * Mitigation: Switch to cached sample data, explain "production uses live API"
   * Demo Strategy: Show code calling API, display cached results
   * Narrative: "In production this calls [API], for demo stability we're showing cached responses"
Failure Mode: Agent Coordination Broken

AI Roadmap
Based on your comprehensive prompt and the current Gemini 3 Bengaluru Hackathon happening today, I'll create all requested deliverables optimized for your 6-hour, 2-person team constraint.
📋 DELIVERABLE 1: EXPANDED VISION DOCUMENT
Project Name: Sidequest
"From scroll to story: Turn social media inspiration into plot-first experiences"
Core Thesis
Urban India is experiencing a cultural reset driven by digital fatigue and analog renaissance. The opportunity lies in capturing the Instagram-to-IRL gap: people see compelling experiences on social media but face massive friction converting inspiration to action. Sidequest bridges this gap using Gemini 3's multimodal capabilities to extract experiences from social content and generate culturally-grounded, story-driven itineraries.[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​cerebralvalley+1
Market Validation:
   * 80% of urban Indians want personalized cultural engagement[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
   * 78 out of 10 Indians explored new experience categories in 2025[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
   * Going-out revenue jumped 3.5× YoY (₹73 Cr → ₹259 Cr)[linkedin]​
   * Urban Indians spend 11% of daily time in culture/leisure (up from 9.9% in 2019)[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
Experience Economy Behavioral Shifts
   1. Plot-First Culture: The new luxury is earned experiences with provenance - friction creates memory, not convenience[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
   2. Collision Economy: Novel stimulus through unlikely pairings (pottery + sound healing, padel + founder networking) defeats algorithmic sameness[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
   3. Proof-of-Life Signaling: Validation moving off-social - experiences felt in the body via energy, mood, stimulus[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
   4. Ambient Belonging: 83% of Indian Gen Z choose community fitness classes; arriving alone is autonomy, not loneliness[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
   5. Dual Prime Times: 40% of dining now on weekdays; mornings as valid as evenings - status by schedule[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
Differentiated Value Proposition
Problem: Existing platforms (Google Maps, MakeMyTrip, District) optimize for convenience over memory, transactions over transformation.[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
Solution: Sidequest is identity scaffolding for the experience economy - helping users convert digital fatigue into plot-first living.[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
Unique Moat:
   * Social Media Ingestion: Direct extraction from Instagram Reels/YouTube vlogs using Gemini Vision[cerebralvalley]​[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
   * Hyperlocal Curation: Small-scale artisans, hidden workshops, supper clubs not on Google Maps[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
   * Narrative-Driven Itineraries: Story arcs with intentional friction, lore, and provenance[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
   * Cultural Autobiography: Track neighborhoods explored, interest pods formed, taste evolution[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
Gemini 3 Centrality
Gemini 3's capabilities make this uniquely possible:[cerebralvalley]​
   1. Multimodal Understanding: Extract experiences from Instagram Reels, YouTube vlogs, menu photos
   2. Long Context Reasoning: Process entire blog posts, synthesize multiple social sources
   3. Cultural Depth: India-specific localization beyond translation (timing, etiquette, dress codes)
   4. Generative Planning: Craft narrative itineraries with emotional arcs, not just chronological lists
   5. Reduced Latency: Flash for fast discovery, Pro for deep reasoning[cerebralvalley]​
Target Users & Use Cases
Primary Persona: "The Cultural Nomad" (25-35, Bangalore/Mumbai)
   * Wants to experiment with identity pods (food nerd, run club, art) without commitment
   * Seeks solo-sure experiences with ambient belonging
   * Use Case Priority: Solo physical activities (run clubs, pottery workshops) + Shopping (artisan markets)[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
Secondary Persona: "The Plot Seeker"
   * Values earned experiences over effortless ones
   * Willing to queue, trek, learn - friction creates stories
   * Use Case Priority: Travel (heritage walks, hidden gems) + Architectural exploration[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
Tertiary Persona: "The Collision Hunter"
   * Bored by predictable nights, seeks novel stimulus
   * Early adopter energy, first-mover advantage
   * Use Case Priority: Networking events + Unlikely experience pairings[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​

2. Cultural Context Agent
Purpose: Add India-specific localization beyond translation[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
Model: Gemini 3 Pro (requires cultural reasoning)
Inputs: discovered_experiences from Discovery Agent
Processing (Gemini Pro Prompt):
text
For each experience, add:


1. **Optimal Timing**: When locals go, cultural significance of timing
   (e.g., "9-11am coffee culture peak in Bangalore")


2. **Dress Code & Etiquette**: Temple visits, upscale dining, workshop attire


3. **Transport Hacks**: Auto negotiation tips, metro shortcuts, parking reality


4. **Social Norms**: Solo dining accepted? Conversation culture? Photography rules?


5. **Religious/Cultural Considerations**: Festival timing, Ramadan adjustments


6. **Safety & Accessibility**: Well-lit evening, wheelchair access, women-solo-friendly


Experiences: {experiences}
City: {city}


Outputs:
python
{
  "cultural_context": {
    "CTR Benne Dosa": {
      "timing": "7-11am peak (locals breakfast culture)",
      "dress": "Casual, temple-adjacent so modest",
      "transport": "Auto from Lalbagh ₹80, walking distance from Bull Temple",
      "social": "Counter seating = conversation-friendly, 40% solo diners",
      "safety": "Very safe, family crowd"
    }
  }
}

3. Plot-Builder Agent (Innovation Core)
Purpose: Generate narrative itineraries with emotional arcs, not chronological lists[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
Model: Gemini 3 Pro (creative storytelling)
Inputs:
      * discovered_experiences
      * cultural_context
      * user_interest_pods: list[str] (e.g., ["food_nerd", "craft_explorer"])
Processing (Gemini Pro Prompt):
text
Create a plot-first itinerary with narrative arc:


**Principles**:
1. **Setup → Friction → Payoff**: Story structure, not just timeline
2. **Intentional Friction**: Queueing, trekking, learning = memory-making
3. **Lore Layering**: Backstory, provenance, "why this matters"
4. **Collision Suggestions**: Mix interest pods (pottery + food + music)
5. **Time-Fluid**: Dawn + evening in same day (dual prime times)


**Tone**: Evocative but grounded, "you" voice, sensory details


**Output Format**:
- Opening hook (why this day matters)
- 3-5 experiences with:
  - Time + place
  - Friction element ("queue 20 mins - locals gather here")
  - Lore ("80-year-old institution, unchanged recipe")
  - Social scaffolding ("counter seating, easy conversation starters")
- Closing reflection (what you'll remember)


Experiences: {experiences}
Context: {context}
User pods: {interest_pods}


Outputs:
python
{
  "narrative_itinerary": """
Your Saturday begins where Bangalore's heritage coffee culture still lives...


9:00 AM – CTR, Malleswaram
Start at Mavalli Tiffin Room's benne dosa. Yes, you'll queue 20 minutes—
locals have been gathering here since 1924, and the wait is part of the 
ritual. The friction earns you a table. Counter seating = easy conversation 
with strangers who become breakfast companions.


*Solo-sure: 40% diners arrive alone. Order at counter, seat yourself.*


10:30 AM – Basavanagudi Heritage Walk

Purpose: Cost transparency, deals discovery, booking timeline[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
Model: Gemini 3 Flash (fast numerical analysis)
Inputs: discovered_experiences, budget_range
Processing:
      1. Aggregate costs: Entry + avg spend + transport + hidden costs
      2. Check for deals: Early bird, BNPL, group discounts
      3. Booking urgency: "Book trek 3 days ahead (sells out)"[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
      4. Alternative suggestions if over budget
Outputs:

5. Community Agent
Purpose: Solo-sure filtering, social scaffolding cues, ambient belonging[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
Model: Gemini 3 Flash (pattern matching)
Inputs: discovered_experiences
Processing:
      1. Analyze social dynamics: Group-assumed vs solo-friendly
      2. Tag beginner energy vs expertise-welcome
      3. Conversation scaffolding: "Chef-interactive counter" vs "quiet contemplation"
      4. Predict solo attendance % (based on experience type)
Outputs:
python
{
  "social_scaffolding": {
    "CTR": {
      "solo_friendly": true,
      "solo_percentage": "40%",
      "scaffolding": "Counter seating enables easy conversation with strangers",

Supervisor Coordination Flow
LangGraph Supervisor Pattern:[changelog.langchain]​[youtube]​
python
from langgraph_supervisor import create_supervisor


# Define agents as subgraphs
agents = {
    "discovery": discovery_agent,
    "cultural_context": cultural_context_agent,
    "plot_builder": plot_builder_agent,
    "budget": budget_optimizer_agent,
    "community": community_agent
}


# Create supervisor with Gemini 3 Flash for routing
supervisor = create_supervisor(
    agents=agents,
    model="gemini-3-flash",
    output_mode="final"  # Only return final itinerary
)


# State flows through agents sequentially
# Supervisor decides routing based on user query


Execution Flow:
      1. User query → Supervisor analyzes intent
      2. Supervisor routes to Discovery Agent
      3. Discovery outputs fed to Cultural Context + Community (parallel)
      4. Combined outputs → Plot-Builder Agent
      5. Budget Optimizer runs final cost check
      6. Supervisor synthesizes narrative_itinerary + metadata
      7. Return to user with agent trace for demo
Why This Works for Hackathon:
      * Pre-built coordination (don't write routing logic)[changelog.langchain]​
      * Transparent tracing (show judges agent collaboration)[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
      * Modular (can add/remove agents easily)
      * Gemini-native (all agents use Gemini models)[cerebralvalley]​
